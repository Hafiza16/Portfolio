    <b>WORDLE IN PYTHON</b>
  </div>

  <br>

  <div class="projectContent">
    <p>As part of a Computing project, I had re-created the world-famous games
      of Wordle in Python using the Guizero library:
      <br>
      <br>
      <img src="WordleScreenshots\firstScreen.png" alt="W3Schools.com" style="float:right;margin-right:15px;">
    </p>
    <p>As you can see in the image on the right, the player is presented with a 
      5 by 6 grid in which they can enter 6 guesses of five letters. To do this, 
      they need to enter their guess in the textbox input field and press the 
      pink button. 
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>If the user has the exact same letter in the same place, the letter goes green. 
      However, if the user has the same letter but in a different place, the letter
      turns yellow, and if that letter is not in the word, it turns red.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>Once the user guesses the word correctly before using all of their guesses, 
      a message appears saying "Congrats" and they are not allowed to enter 
      anymore guesses. Otherwise, the word is shown once the player has used all of 
      the guesses and still has not got the word correct. 
    </p>
    
    <br>
    <img src="WordleScreenshots\firstGuess.png" alt="W3Schools.com" style="float:left;margin-right:15px;">
    <p style="margin-left:20px;">
      In the following screenshot, I am guessing a word to demonstrate
      the colour coding for the letters that occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also 
      messages to motivate the user to keep guessing, which are 
      randomly selected from a string array to ensure they are 
      different each time the player makes a guess. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Each time the user makes a guess, it fills in the next row of 
      the grid with what they have entered (only entering the first 
      five letters the player has input into the textbox, even if they
      have entered more letters.)
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    
    <img src="WordleScreenshots\correctGuess.png" alt="W3Schools.com" style="float:right;margin-right:15px;">
    <p>In this screenshot, a full game of Wordle is happening, with the word
      being correctly guessed after five attempts: 
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
    </p>

  <div class="projectHeader">
    <b>TEXT-BASED ADVENTURE</b>
  </div>

  <br>

  <div class="projectContent">
    <p>In Python, I had attempted to create a text-based adventure game
      similar to the online game Zork. These text-based games follow the 
      simple basis of setting a storyline for the player and asking 
      them to enter text-based inputs, allowing them to determine 
      what happens next. 

      <p>
        In the screenshot below, there is a short introduction for the player
        to read, allowing for them to understand the rules of and how to 
        play the game: 
      </p>
      
      <br>

      <img src="ZorkScreenshots\intro.png" style="width:1200px;margin-left:-1px;display:block;">
      <br>
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="ZorkScreenshots\direction.png" style="margin-left:10px;width:800px;float:right;margin-right:-8px;">
      The player is then required to enter a specific cardinal direction, 
      resulting in a specific room that is entered.
      
      <p>
        From here, the player
        can choose areas to search for items, and can: 
      </p>
      <ul class="ListFormatLeft">
        <li>Pick up an item</li>
        <li>Leave the item</li>
        <li>Return to the main hallway</li>
        <li>View their inventory</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The player must choose an option to be able to progress 
        onto the next step of the game. 
      </p>
      <br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the player has collected all of the items from all of the 
      rooms that have been explored, the player enters into a battle
      with a mythical creature:
      <br>
      <br>
      <img src="ZorkScreenshots\endBattle.png" style="float:left;margin-left:-5px;margin-right:10px;width:900px;">
      <p>
        The player is reminded of the items in their inventory, and they must choose only
        three items from the inventory in order to enter the battle with the mythical creature.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there is a specific combination of items which will make the player
        successful in defeating the creature !
      </p>

    <b>SPEEDY KEYS</b>
  </div>

  <br>

  <div class="projectContent">
    <p>
      For my A Level Computer Science Project, I had decided to create a game 
      using C# for Unity Development. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The initial idea was to create a game in which random objects would appear
      on the screen at random times with an associated key and a time limit, 
      and the user would have to press that key before the time ended in order 
      to successfully save the object (and not lose a life).
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I was unable to achieve this due to limitations of creating and 
      instantiating too many objects in the game at a time, as spawing too many 
      objects at the same time was causing the game to crash or become laggy, 
      therefore I had to change my initial idea in order to reduce the effects 
      of this. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, I decided to keep the initial game design the same, but the player
      had a character they could control using WASD keys and the aim was to collect
      as many coins as possible in order to exchange them to design their own 
      character. As the levels went on, there were difficulties added e.g. having
      to avoid certain objects otherwise a life would be lost or having a boost.
    </p>

      The above images are screenshots of the game in action, with the player
      being able to collect coins, avoid enemies and create their own character 
      in the drawing canvas.

    <b>STUDY SPACER</b>
  </div>

  <br>

  <div class="projectContent">
    <p>For my BTEC Computing project, I was tasked with creating an application 
      to help students with planning their study and revision. I wanted to create 
      an application that was available on both Android and iOS platforms, so I 
      had developed this application using Thunkable, using Adobe XD for 
      prototyping. 
      </p>

      <br>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="StudySpacer\loading.png" style="width:100%;margin-left:150px;">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="StudySpacer\options.png" style="width:44%;margin-left:190px;">
        </div>
      </div>

      <br>
      <p>As you can see in the screenshot on the left, there is a loading screen
        with the app name "Study Spacer", which is shortly followed by an 
        introduction screen. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The intro screen provides the user with an overview of the app and its 
        purpose, allowing them to gain a better understanding of the app.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have decided to use a panda image as the logo and a light blue for 
        the background to provide the user with a calm and relaxing 
        space in which they can map out their revision. This is because 
        I feel that it is important for the student (the user) to be 
        in this calm space in order to maximise their productivity when 
        revising. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the user clicks the "Sounds Good" button, they are taken to a
        page with three options (on the right).
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>Here is an example of what the timetable looks like day by day (with
        clickable buttons) on the left:
        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">
            <img src="StudySpacer\timetable.png" style="width:44%;margin-left:50px;">
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="StudySpacer\notes.png" style="width:120%;margin-left:-120px;">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          And on the right, the user can make their own notes, giving them a title 
          and a description. They can then view their notes by their title name 
          and click on the button to view the actual note. 
        </p>
      </p>
      <br>
  </div>
