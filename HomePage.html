    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Hi! My name is Hafiza and here is the site I have created in order to showcase
      some of my achievements and projects that I have accomplished over the years.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>Even though I come from a family who are not in the world of technology, I have always
      been fascinated by computers and programming, hence why I decided to study these
      subjects since GCSE Level, going on to doing Computer Science and Mathematics
      at A Levels. 
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>Anything to do with computers or programming in general fascinates me, but I 
      would specifically like to develop a career in the games industry. This is 
      because, not only does it involve a lot of programming, but it also has
      creative paths, which I also like to take an interest in.
    </p>

    <br>
